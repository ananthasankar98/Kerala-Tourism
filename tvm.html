                <p>A city adorned with lush greenery, tranquil backwaters and exquisite beaches is Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city and cultural hub of God,s Own Country. This "Evergreen City of India" is located in the southwestern tip of Indian mainland and lies straddled by the Arabian Sea in the west and the magnificent highlands of Western Ghats in the east. The city is named after Ananda Padmanabha or Lord Vishnu, owing to the great legacy of the erstwhile rulers of Travancore who dedicated their Kingdom to Lord Padmanabha, the presiding deity of Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Apart from the incredible beauty of the many internationally renowned beaches and delightful picnic spots, the city is also home to many historical monuments and temples. Start out a journey to this clean and green city of Kerala, explore and revel in its mystic charm.</p>
